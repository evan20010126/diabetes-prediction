# Data Science Project - Predict Diabetes From Medical Records

Build a predictive model to identify the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on their medical records. By leveraging structured health data such as Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin and so on.

## Datasets
- [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- [Frankfurt Hospital (Germany) Type 2 Diabetes Datase](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndasilva/diabetes/data)
> Install those files, and put them into './data'

```
E.g.
data/
| - .gitkeep
| - Frankfurt_Hospital_diabetes.csv
| - Pima_Indians_diabetes.csv
```

## Environment
```bash
# Follow the template to commit
git config commit.template .gitmessage.txt

# Install needed packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Install this project in editable mode (requires setup.py)
pip install -e .
```

## Run
- Run PIMA dataset:
1. Run non-data-leakage version 
    ```sh
      sh ./launch/run_pima_non_dataleakage.sh
    ```
2. Run data-leakage version 
    ```sh
      sh ./launch/run_pima_dataleakage.sh
    ```

- Run Frankfurt dataset:`sh ./launch/run_frankfurt.sh`

## üìÅ Folder and File Descriptions

### `configs/`
- Stores model configurations and training parameters in `.yaml` files.
- **Suggested naming**: `train.yaml`, `test.yaml`, etc.

---

### `cores/`
- Encapsulates the **core logic** of the project (classes and functions for flow control).
- `trainer.py`: Contains the `Trainer` class for training logic (e.g., training loop, validation, saving model).
- `inferencer.py`: Contains the `Inferencer` class for inference logic (e.g., single image prediction, batch inference).

---

### `data/`
- Stores datasets used by the project.
- For example, you can place `diabetes.csv` here.

---

### `launch/`
- Scripts for launching or executing the project.

---

### `models/`
- Defines model architectures.
- Place your PyTorch, TensorFlow, or custom model classes here.
- **Example**: `unet.py`, `resnet_classifier.py`, `tabnet.py`, etc.

---

### `outputs/`
- Stores training or inference results.
- **Suggested subfolders**:
  - `tools/`: Scripts for inference visualization and result analysis.
  - `training/`: Stores training outputs such as checkpoints, loss curves, and TensorBoard logs.

---

### `scripts/`
- Entry-point scripts for execution.
- `train.py`: Main training script responsible for loading configs, initializing the trainer, and running the training process.
- You may also add `predict.py`, `test.py`, etc. for other tasks.

---

### `utils/`
- Utility functions and shared logic.
- `logger_util.py`: Handles logging initialization and formatting (e.g., recording training information).
- **Other suggested modules**:
  - `model_util.py`: Includes functions like `prepare_model`, `load_checkpoint`, and `save_model`.
  - `metrics.py`: Contains evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, IoU, Dice score).

---

### `tests/`
- Unit tests for various components.
- **Example**: `test_logger.py`

---

## ‚úÖ Development Suggestions
- Keep core logic in `cores/` and execution logic in `scripts/` separated.
- Modularize reusable functions into `utils/`.
- Organize model definitions in `models/` for better maintainability.
